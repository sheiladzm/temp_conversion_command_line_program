Temperature Conversion Command Line Program

This command line program helps a user to convert a temperature in degrees (C)elsius to (F)ahrenheit or vice versa. First, it will prompt the user to enter a temperature in number format. Next, it will ask whether the temperature entered is in Celsius or Fahrenheit. Depending on what the user enters, the program will return a temperature converted in the desired unit of measure.

Objectives:

- Learn the process of creating a command line application in Java and be able to run it in IntelliJ IDEA CE
- Prompt and accept user input
- Correctly parse input to a primitive data type
- Use appropriate variable names and data types
- Apply the appropriate temperature conversion formula to calculate data
- Show understanding of logical branching in Java
- Write the correct output to the console

Challenges Faced:

- Used double equals instead of .equals method to check for String equality
- Initially used the wrong temperature conversion formula
- Unclear on prompt statements on the expected formatting of user input

Tips:

- Open the folder in IntelliJ IDEA CE and find the file TempConvert.java to view code
- Right click TempConvert and click on Run 'TempConvert.main()'
- The command line program should run and you may enter your inputs inside the command line.

Enjoy!
