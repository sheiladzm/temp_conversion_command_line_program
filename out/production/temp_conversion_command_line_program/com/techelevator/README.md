Temperature Conversion Command Line Program

This command line program helps a user to convert a temperature in degrees (C)elsius to (F)ahrenheit or vice versa. First, it will prompt the user to enter a temperature in number format. Next, it will ask whether the temperature entered is in Celsius or Fahrenheit. Depending on what the user enters, the program will return a temperature converted in the desired unit of measure.
